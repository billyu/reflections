What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    It will creat a hidden directory called ".git" to store all of the meta data and version history.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area is a transit space for us to prepare files to be commited to repository. It is useful when we are going to commit multiple files in a single commit.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    Before committing to the repository, check if the staging area contains the files are related in one logical change. If not, we need to seperate them into 2 or combine more files to 1 commit.
