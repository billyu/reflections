When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would always use a remote repository for the following reason:
  1. Secured: I never know when my hard drive will stop working, if that happened, I would at least have a working version on the network.
  2. Collaborate: I could work with other developer simultaneously.
This is a made-up question, it will be deleted later.
