When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would always use a remote repository for the following reason:
  1. Secured: I never know when my hard drive will stop working, if that happened, I would at least have a working version on the network.
  2. Collaborate: I could work with other developer simultaneously.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  By manually pull changes, I can control the status of my local repository. Because, I might need to make changes to files simultaneously. 
  If it is done automatically, it might conflict with my changes and confuse me.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Clone is a entire copy of a repository, either locally or remotely. A fork is a copy of repository on GitHub. Branch is part of a repository representing a path of commits.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  We could see the "whole picture" of the current modification history, it will help us make wise "merge" decisions.
